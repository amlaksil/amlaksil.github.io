      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <article>
The Maze game project is a captivating and immersive gaming experience that showcases the successful implementation of raycasting algorithms using C and the SDL2 library. In this project, I have created a thrilling maze exploration game that challenges players to navigate through intricate labyrinths filled with twists, turns, and surprises.

Using the power of raycasting, the game provides a pseudo-3D effect, immersing players in a visually striking environment. The walls, ceiling, and floor are rendered with realistic textures, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere. Players can rotate their view in real-time, allowing them to explore the maze from different angles and discover hidden paths.

One of the key features of the Maze game is the fluid player movement. Players can smoothly navigate through the maze, sliding along walls with realistic collision detection. This adds a layer of authenticity to the gameplay, making it both challenging and satisfying.

To enhance the overall experience, I have implemented a custom map parser that allows for dynamic maze layouts. This means that players can enjoy a variety of maze configurations, ensuring each playthrough is unique and engaging.

Throughout the development process, I have tackled various challenges, including understanding and implementing complex raycasting algorithms, optimizing performance, and maintaining accurate rendering. These challenges have provided valuable learning opportunities and have helped me expand my technical expertise in game development and real-time rendering.

The Maze game project serves as a testament to my dedication, determination, and passion for creating immersive gaming experiences. I am proud to have completed this project and share it with fellow gaming enthusiasts and aspiring game developers. So, put your skills to the test, navigate through the maze, and see if you can conquer its twists and turns!
